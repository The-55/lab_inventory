# PART 1 : The limitations of of this monolithic approach : 

- Tight coupling because all code is in one file
- Hard to reuse cannot use parts in other applications
- No API - Other apps cannot connect to it
- Hard to test due to the difficulty to write unit tests

# PART 2 : How SOAP enforces structure and contracts compared to monolithic script:

- Data types are clearly defined (Integer, String, Float)
- Each method has defined inputs and outputs
- Any language can use the SOAP service
